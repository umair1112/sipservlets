# Write a testcase and Run the TestSuite for Mobicents Sip Servlets #

## Add an application to the test suite ##

Copy one of the sample app loacted in http://code.google.com/p/sipservlets/source/browse/#git%2Fsip-servlets-test-suite%2Fapplications and rename it to yourappname.
Modify it's pom.xml and add yourappname in the modules section of the parent pom.xml located in sip-servlets-test-suite\applications (This allow to build all the applications before running the test suite)
We will now make it available in eclipse...
Open up eclipse and go to the sip-servlets-test-suite project, click on the right button then properties.
On the properties popup that just came up go to Java Build Path and then to source tab.
Add a new folder in selecting sip-servlets-test-suite\applications\yourappname\src\main\java
Edit the output folder of the new folder you just created to make it go to sip-servlets-test-suite\applications\yourappname\src\main\sipapp
Modify your application to cover your use case and don't forget to modify the sip.xml.

## Add a test case for the newly created application ##

Add a test case for your app in testsuite/src/test/java/org/mobicents/servlet/sip/testsuite/yourpackagename/yourtestcase and the corresponding dar configuration file (otherwise your application will never get picked up by the application router) in testsuite/src/test/resources/org/mobicents/servlet/sip/testsuite/yourpackagename/ Make sure the locations in your test case specified in the following methods are correct deployApplication() and getDarConfigurationFile(). Select your test case in eclipse and run it as a junit test.
