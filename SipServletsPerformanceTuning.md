# Performance Tuning #

Performance tuning SIP Servlets applications is a non-trivial exercise that requires good understanding of JVM, Garbage Collection, and SIP Servlet semantics.

At JUDCon 2011, Jean Deruelle and Naoki Nishihara presented best practices for tuning Mobicents SIP Servlets.

The presentation is published on `SlideShare`:

The [Performance User Guide](https://mobicents.ci.cloudbees.com/job/Mobicents-SipServlets-Release/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/documentation/html_single/index.html#bp-Best_Practices_Perf_Tips) does provide handful information as well

[Another thread](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/mobicents-public/HX1Oj8H0c_M/discussion) on the google group can provide good insights
